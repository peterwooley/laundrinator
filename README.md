# I hate laundry
There is little in my life that I dislike as much as laundry. It's labor intesnive, it requires monotonous work at every level (sorting, washing, drying, folding, putting away), but it's too expensive to pay someone to do it all.

# I've got a plan
I don't have a very good plan, but it's a plan. Recently, thanks to my friend and colleague [Joshua Benuck](https://github.com/joshuabenuck), I've found an interest in hacking electronics. Armed with a borrowed copy of [Making Things Move](http://www.makingthingsmove.com/about-the-book/) and some money to spend at [Adafruit](http://adafruit.com/), I'll attempt to take on the beast.

# Step 1: Dryer Control
My attempt to make laundry easier starts at the dryer. Using an Arduino, solenoid and servo, I'll be making a device that, with the the click of a single button, will turn the dryer knob to the longest setting and push the start button. By making this digital, I should (slightly) simplify the act of starting the dryer while also laying the groundwork for future automation.
